## Project Overview

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Understanding and Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, features, and patterns.

2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, converting non-numeric data, and performing feature engineering.

3. **Modeling**: Building, evaluating, and iterating on regression models to predict house prices.

4. **Results and Visualization**: Visualizing model performance and presenting the findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `kc_house_data.csv`. It contains information about house sales in King County, Washington, including features such as square footage, renovation year, location coordinates, and more.
